=====================

This repo contains old [Harvard DCE](http://www.dce.harvard.edu/)-specific extensions to the [Opencast Paella video player bridging code](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/tree/develop/modules/engage-paella-player).

As of Nov 2019, the Opencaast-Paella bridging code is part of the Opencast enaage-player-paella module. DCE creates updates to the Opencast bridging code in place in the DCE Opencast repository (in Bitbucket as of Oct 2020)

This repository is no longer used.
